## Test it with random wiki paragraph (I tried google wiki)

Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include a search engine, online advertising, cloud computing, software, artificial intelligence,[10] quantum computing,[11] and hardware. It has been referred to as the "most powerful company in the world" and one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the area of artificial intelligence.[12][13][14] It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.

Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of the stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[15]

The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases including email (Gmail), navigation (Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photo), video calling (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Fitbit), gaming (Stadia), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (TV), artificial intelligence (Assistant), machine learning (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. The company is also notorious for its vast portfolio of discontinued or replaced products,[16][17] which includes Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.

Google is well-known for it highly ambitious technological innovations aimed at solving humanity's biggest problems.[18] Some of these innovations include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google self-driving project), and smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), transformer models (Google Brain).

Google.com and YouTube.com are the two most visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and Twitter. Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation service, email provider, office suite, video sharing platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, ML framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes[19] and fourth by Interbrand.[20] It has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly position.
